Proposal

Next Song: The easy way to find new music from Spotify!

WHAT INSTRUCTORS WANT TO KNOW

Tech Used - tesing with mocha/chai, node.js, mongo, bootstrap, express server, & js/jQuery.

Approach - It was my intention to build the project in this order: Authentication, heroku setup, routes from personal api, routes from 3rd party api, tests, css.

Installation Instructions - currently the only instructions for users on the front-end are to sign in or login and read the hardcoded joke, or link to the subreddit I planned on pulling the api from.

Unsolved Problems - Need to get heroku correctly connectd, routes working and tests passing. I know way more about heroku errors then I could have imagined.

Overview

This second project is your first foray into building a full-stack application. You'll be building a Node app, which means you'll learn about what it takes to build a functional application from the ground up yourself.

This is exciting! It's a lot, but we'll give you the tools over the next couple weeks to be able build what you need, and you get to decide what you do with it. And you get to be creative in choosing what sort of application you want to build!

You will be working individually for this project, and you'll be designing the app yourself. We hope you'll exercise creativity on this project, sketch some wireframes before you start, and write user stories to define what your users will want to do with the app. Make sure you have time to run these ideas by your instructors to get their feedback before you dive too deep into code! Remember to keep things small and focus on mastering the fundamentals – scope creep/feature creep is the biggest pitfall for any project!

Requirements

Your app must:

Have at least 2 models (more if they make sense) – one representing someone using your application, and one that represents the main functional idea for your app
Have at least 2 software unit tests using Mocha and Chai
Interface with a 3rd Party Web API of your choosing
Include sign up/log in functionality, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow
Have complete RESTful routes for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
Utilize Mongo to create a database structure and interact with your JSON-like data
Include wireframes that you designed during the planning process
Have semantically clean HTML and CSS
Be deployed online and accessible to the public
Necessary Deliverables

A working full-stack application, built by you, hosted somewhere on the internet
A link to your hosted working app in the URL section of your GitHub repo
A git repository hosted on GitHub, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project. Commit early, commit often.
A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
Wireframes of your app, hosted somewhere & linked in your readme
A link in your readme.md to the publicly-accessible user stories you created
Suggested Ways to Get Started

Begin with the end in mind. Know where you want to go by planning with wireframes & user stories, so you don't waste time building things you don't need
Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code to solve short term problems
Read the docs for whatever technologies you use. Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer
Commit early, commit often. Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
User stories define what a specific type of user wants to accomplish with your application. It's tempting to just make them to-do lists for what needs to get done, but if you keep them small & focused on what a user cares about from their perspective, it'll help you know what to build
Write pseudocode before you write actual code. Thinking through the logic of something helps.
Potential Project Ideas

Cheerups

The world is a depressing place.

Your task is to create an app that will allow people to create and share "cheerups" - happy little quips to brighten other people's' days. Cheerups will be small - limited to 139 characters. Members will be able to promote Cheerups that they like and maybe even boost the reputation of the Cheerupper.

Bookmarket

You will create an application where users can bookmark links they want to keep.

But what if users could trade bookmarks for other bookmarks? Or sell bookmarks for points? Or send bookmarks to your friends. Or something even crazier.

Photo sharing app

Users will be able to register and create albums and photos. Albums and photos will need to be named and described by their owners. Users will be able to view other user's' albums. Maybe users can comment on photos, or either up/down vote them.

Useful Resources

Heroku (for hosting your back-end)
Writing Good User Stories (for a few user story tips)
Presenting Information Architecture (for more insight into wireframing)
Project Feedback + Evaluation

There are several requirements in the Project 2 rubric. Your instructors will score each of your requirements below using this scale:

Score | Expectations
----- | ------------
**0** | _Incomplete._
**1** | _Does not meet expectations._
**2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
**3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but the more important scores are the individual ones above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!

Project Workflow: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

Technical Requirements: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

Creativity: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

Code Quality: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

Deployment: Did you deploy your application to a public url using GitHub Pages?

Professional Development: Did you demonstrates ability to communicate and collaborate with others in the classroom and/or on a team? Did you treat your peers, teammates, instructors with respect, make and follow agreements, and maintain a growth mindset?
